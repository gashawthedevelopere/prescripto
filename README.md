This repository will guide you through creating a Full Stack Doctor Appointment Booking system using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). It involves building a website that allows patients to log in, book appointments, and manage them; doctors to check their appointments and earnings and update their profiles; and an admin dashboard for managing appointments and doctor profiles. Additionally, the project will integrate online payment gateways for appointment fees. You can customize this application for your college projects or personal portfolio.
